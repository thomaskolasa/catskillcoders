## Welcome to Catskill Coders

Catskill Coders is a free mentoring program with the goal of growing interest in technology in the Catskill region. 

Due to Covid-19, many people had no choice but to start working remotely. Since more companies will be open to the idea of remote work, employees will no longer be expected to live in Silicon Valley or New York City. Instead, a new Silicon Valley can develop in the valleys of the Catskills. With the right preparation, rewarding jobs in the tech sector await those who work hard. 

> Mission: To introduce rural and underprivileged youth and adults to computer science education and careers in technology.

The main purpose of this group is learning how to learn. No time in history had so many resources available to everyone via the internet. While there are countless courses, blog posts, and tutorials online, experienced mentorship and community can help make sense of the overload of materials.

Our approach involves:
- Guidance on which resources to pursue
- Debugging help when getting stuck
- Community support to hold you accountable
- Experienced career coaching
