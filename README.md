## Welcome to Catskill Coders

![mountains](/assets/mountainsclouds.png)

Catskill Coders is a free mentoring program with the goal of growing interest in technology in the Catskill Mountains region.

Due to Covid-19, many people had no choice but to start working remotely. More companies will be open to the idea of remote work and a new Silicon Valley can develop in the valleys of the Catskills. With the right preparation, rewarding jobs in the tech sector await those who work hard.

> Mission: To introduce rural and underprivileged communities to computer science education and careers in technology.

The main purpose of this group is learning how to learn. No time in history had so many resources available to everyone via the internet. While there are countless courses, blog posts, and tutorials online, experienced mentorship and community can help make sense of the information overload.

Our approach involves:
- Structure and guidance for which resources to pursue
- Debugging help when getting stuck
- Community support to hold you accountable
- Experienced career coaching

Who should join
Catskill Coders is looking for coders just starting out their journeys. While itâ€™s perfectly fine to have some experience, we will assume no background at all.

## First Meeting
Our first meeting will be remote on Saturday, May 2nd. If you are interested in joining, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeo-j698pEHPJWOYy-80oK899B6n4g2eb7pbKBfk__oOEYKrg/viewform). All you need is a phone or computer, internet, and grit!
